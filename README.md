Consult SETUP.md to understand how to build this library.
This program currently is able to generate an optimal polygon path simulation. The video describing this process is found here:

After following the instructions in SETUP.md, in your terminal type:
- make packer
<a/>

The executable file will be located in the bin. To run it, in your terminal type
- bin/packer
<a/>

Follow the instruction output in the terminal to run the program correctly. Currently, the only option is to generate the necessary geometry for the program to run. In the future, there will be a read_file function which is able to read custom inputs from a file, rather than generating the geometry randonmly.

An output video showing the polygon tracking through a container should be outputted to your desktop folder. Enjoy!
